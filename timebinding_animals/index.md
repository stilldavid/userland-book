9. time-binding animals
=======================

When I was a kid, I read pretty much all of Robert A. Heinlein's Science
Fiction (the short stories, the early novels, the late novels, everything).
Heinlein was something of a disciple of a guy named Alfred Korzybski, who had
built up one of those elaborate intellectual systems where the whole thing may
be kind of cracked, but there are some useful ideas in there.  You can get a
sense of the flavor of his work from the fact that he wrote a book called
_Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General
Semantics_.

I've never read Korzybski's book, though maybe one day I'll make an attempt.
One of the bits that stuck for me, via Heinlein's fiction, was the notion that
humans, unique in the animal kingdom, are "time binders":  Creatures capable of
accumulating knowledge and retaining it between generations, so that one set of
us can pick up where another set of us left off, not only learning things
within an individual lifetime, but benefiting from the learning of previous
lives and transmitting our own progress well beyond the temporal boundaries of
a single existence.

There's a useful sense in which the history of civilization is the history of
technology, broadly understood.  And a good deal of the history of technology
is bound up in the ways that technology augments and amplifies memory.
