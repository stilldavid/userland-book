bits that might become end notes later
--------------------------------------

I just ran `dict model`.  It's a word with many fascinating definitions, but my
favorite of the bunch is probably this bit of ridiculous, eye-glazing
prolixity:

     9. An abstract and often simplified conceptual representation
        of the workings of a system of objects in the real world,
        which often includes mathematical or logical objects and
        relations representing the objects and relations in the
        real-world system, and constructed for the purpose of
        explaining the workings of the system or predicting its
        behavior under hypothetical conditions; as, the
        administration's model of the United States economy
        predicts budget surpluses for the next fifteen years;
        different models of the universe assume different values
        for the cosmological constant; models of proton structure
        have grown progressively more complex in the past century.

This one is also pretty good:

    From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (26 July 2010) [foldoc]:

     1. <simulation> A description of observed or predicted
     behaviour of some system, simplified by ignoring certain
     details.  Models allow complex {systems}, both existent and
     merely specified, to be understood and their behaviour
     predicted.  A model may give incorrect descriptions and
     predictions for situations outside the realm of its intended
     use.  A model may be used as the basis for {simulation}.
