a book about the command line for humans
========================================

Late last year, [a side trip](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) into simple text utilities
got me thinking about how many of my writing habits depend on the Linux command
line.  This struck me as a decent hook for talking about the tools I use every
day with an audience of mixed technical background.

So now I'm writing a (short, haphazard) book.  This isn't a book about system
administration, or writing big software systems, or becoming a wizard.  I am
not a wizard, and I don't subscribe to the idea that wizardry is a requirement
for using these tools.  In fact I barely know what I'm doing most of the time,
but hey, I get some stuff done.

My hope herein is that I can convey something useful to people I know who use
computers every day, but for whom the command line environment is mystifying,
obscure, and generally uninviting.  I intend to gloss over many complexities in
favor of demonstrating a rough-and-ready toolset that's helped me immeasurably
in my own work.

This is very much a work in progress, and some sections may be absent or
riddled with error.
