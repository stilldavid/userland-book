a book about the command line for humans
========================================

Late last year, [a side trip](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) into text utilities got me
thinking about how much my writing habits depend on the Linux command line.
This struck me as a good hook for talking about the tools I use every day
with an audience of mixed technical background.

So now I'm writing a (short, haphazard) book.  This isn't a book about system
administration, or writing big software systems, or becoming a wizard.  I am
not a wizard, and I don't subscribe to the idea that wizardry is a requirement
for using these tools.  In fact I barely know what I'm doing most of the time,
but I still get some stuff done.

My hope herein is to convey something useful to people who use computers every
day, but for whom the command line environment seems mystifying, obscure, or
generally uninviting.  I intend to gloss over many complexities in favor of
demonstrating a rough-and-ready toolset.

This is a work in progress, and some sections may be unfinished or riddled with
error.  [p1k3.com/userland-book.git](//p1k3.com/userland-book.git) should be
considered the canonical git repo, but I'm pushing everything to a [GitHub
mirror](https://github.com/brennen/userland-book), and welcome feedback there.
