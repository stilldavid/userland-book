a book about the command line for humans
========================================

In the fall of 2013, [thinking about](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) text utilities got
me thinking in turn about how my writing habits depend on the Linux command
line.  This seems like a good hook for explaining some tools I use every day,
so now I'm writing a short, haphazard book.

This isn't a book about system administration, writing complex software, or
becoming a wizard.  I am not a wizard, and I don't subscribe to the idea that
wizardry required to use these tools.  In fact, I barely know what I'm doing
most of the time.  I still get some stuff done.

This is a work in progress.  It probably gets some stuff wrong.
