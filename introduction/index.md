a book about the command line for humans
========================================

In the fall of 2013, [a digression](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) on text utilities got
me thinking about how my writing habits depend on the Linux command line.  This
seems like a good hook for explaining some tools I use every day, so now I'm
writing a short, haphazard book.

I hope to share something useful with people who use computers regularly, but
for whom the command line environment seems obscure or uninviting.  I plan to
gloss over many complexities in favor of demonstrating a rough-and-ready
toolset.

This isn't a book about system administration, or writing big software systems,
or becoming a wizard.  I am not a wizard, and I don't subscribe to the idea
that wizardry is a requirement for using these tools.  In fact I barely know
what I'm doing most of the time, but I still get some stuff done.

This is a work in progress.  Some sections may be unfinished or riddled with
error.  Incomplete sections will be marked with {notes in curly braces}.
[p1k3.com/userland-book.git](//p1k3.com/userland-book.git) should be considered
the canonical git repo, but I'm pushing everything to a [GitHub
mirror](https://github.com/brennen/userland-book), and welcome feedback there.
