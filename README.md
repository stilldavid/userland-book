userland: a book about the command line for humans
=========================----------===============

A [recent side trip](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) into simple text utilities got me thinking
about how many of my writing habits depend on the Linux command line.  This
struck me as a pretty decent hook for talking about the tools I use with an
audience of mixed technical background (a handful of old Unix heads from way
back, some engineers and hard science types, some gamers & Windows people, some
poets and musicians).

This is a work in progress.  It may eventually be something not unlike a book.
