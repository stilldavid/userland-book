userland: a book about the command line for humans
==================================================

This is a work in progress.

Late last year, [a side trip](//p1k3.com/2013/8/4) into simple text utilities
got me thinking about how many of my writing habits depend on the Linux command
line.  This struck me as a decent hook for talking about the tools I use every
day with an audience of mixed technical background.

So now I'm writing a (short, haphazard) book.  This isn't a book about system
administration, or writing big software systems, or becoming a wizard.  I am
not a wizard, and I don't subscribe to the thesis that wizardry is a
requirement for using these tools.  I barely know what I'm doing most of the
time, but hey, I get some stuff done.

(If you're a friend of mine and I've asked you to take a look at this, don't
feel bad if you don't get around to it.  It's all dry as day-old toast.)
