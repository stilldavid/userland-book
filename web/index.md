7. the internet for humans, and how the command line can help
=============================================================

Web browsers are really complicated these days.  They're full of rendering
engines for layouts and graphics and fonts, audio and video players, one or
more programming languages, sophisticated development tools, databases -- you
name it, and there's a fair chance it's in there somewhere.  The modern web
browser is kitchen sink software, and to make matters worse, it is _utterly
surrounded_ by technobabble.  It takes smart, dedicated people _years_ to
come to terms with the ocean of words about web stuff and sort out the
meaningful ones from snake oil and bureaucratic mysticism.

All of which can make the web itself seem like an absurdly complicated
landscape, and obscure the simplicity of its basic design, which is this:

Some programs pass text files around to one another.

It's more complicated than that, of course, but the gist of it is that the web
is made out of URLs, "Uniform Resource Locators", which are paths to things.
If you squint, these look kind of like paths to files on your filesystem.  A
protocol called HTTP lets software like your browser send a request over the
network for the stuff that lives at a particular URL.

Let's illustrate this.  I've written a really simple web page that lives at
`http://p1k3.com/hello_world.html`.
