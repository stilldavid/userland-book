7. the internet for humans, and how the command line can help
=============================================================

Web browsers are really complicated these days.  They're full of rendering
engines, audio and video players, programming languages, development tools,
databases -- you name it, and there's a fair chance it's in there somewhere.
The modern web browser is kitchen sink software, and to make matters worse, it
is _totally surrounded_ by technobabble.  It can take _years_ to come to terms
with the ocean of words about web stuff and sort out the meaningful ones from
the snake oil and bureaucratic mysticism.

All of which can make the web itself seem like a really complicated landscape,
and obscure the simplicity of its basic design, which is this:

Some programs pass text files around to one another.

It's more complicated than that, of course, but the gist of it is that the web
is made out of URLs, "Uniform Resource Locators", which are paths to things.
If you squint, these look kind of like paths to files on your filesystem.

Let's illustrate this.  I've written a really simple web page that lives at
`http://p1k3.com/hello_world.html`.
