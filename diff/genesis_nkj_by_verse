In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.  And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.  So the evening and the morning were the first day.
